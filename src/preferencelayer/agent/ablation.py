"""How should the agent turn raw quality evidence into a quality score?

The integration milestone showed that *combining* preference and quality is the
big win, and two follow-ups (confidence-adaptive α, then evidence-aware α) showed
that *how the blend is weighted* barely matters — a fixed balanced α is hard to
beat. This module asks the question that actually does move the needle: **how the
quality estimate itself is formed from noisy, unevenly-distributed evidence.**

It compares two estimators, each crossed with two blend weights (a 2×2):

* **estimator** — *Bayesian-shrunk* posteriors (the shipped QIL aggregator, which
  pulls thin-evidence products toward a neutral prior) vs. *raw* confidence-weighted
  sample means (a `QualityAggregator` with ``prior_strength → 0`` — the
  evidence-ignoring ablation);
* **blend weight** — a fixed α=0.5 vs. the per-candidate evidence-aware α.

The headline contrast is the two **fixed-α** cells across a sweep of per-observation
noise (driven by the experiment script): raw averaging is fine — even better — when
review signals are clean, but Bayesian shrinkage is the **noise-robust** choice and
wins once individual signals are noisy (the realistic regime for messy public text).
The two evidence-aware cells are reported alongside to show that α-level
evidence-handling does not help on top of either estimator.

Everything here reuses the existing apparatus: :class:`AgentRecommender`,
:class:`~preferencelayer.qil.aggregate.QualityAggregator` (just re-parameterized),
``eval.metrics`` and the paired bootstrap from ``eval.harness``.
